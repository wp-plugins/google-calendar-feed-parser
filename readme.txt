== Changelog ==

0.4 (not yet released): This version will add error handling to the SimpleXML code as well as various features requested/suggested/submitted by several users of the plugin.

0.3: Switched from using file\_get\_contents() to retrieve URL (which isn't allowed by many hosting providers) to using the WordPress function wp\_remote\_fopen().  This function firsts attempts to use fopen() to get the file and, if that fails, proceeds to use cURL.

0.2: Add ability to configure custom time offsets.  This feature will be replaced with more comprehensive timezone controls in a future release.

0.1: Initial plugin release.
